			\item<2-> \alert{Confidence metric} --- a good one is \textcolor{cyan}{lift}, as it values a rule ability to predict cases comparing it against the odds of a random prediction.
            \item<3-> \alert{Discretization} --- we need \emph{discrete attributes} in order to find logical implications between them;\vspace{0.2cm}
            \item<4-> \alert{Focus on a few attributes} --- the same ones chosen for clustering will do: \textcolor{cyan}{\emph{exam score}, \textcolor{cyan}{\emph{delay} and \textcolor{cyan}{teaching evaluation}}}.
